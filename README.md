# DeepFake Detection

The DeepFake Detection project contains two main folders: </br>

1.AI - This folder contains AI Jupyter notebook files used to develop the proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for forgery detection and classification. The notebook files illustrate the process of training and testing the model using the CASIA dataset.

2.WebApp - This folder contains the web application that is built on the Django framework and provides a user-friendly interface for detecting forged images.

# Running the Web Application

1.Install Python3 and pip3

2.Clone this repository

3.Open a terminal and navigate to the IFAKE_WebApp folder

4.Run the following command to install the required Python packages:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

5.Run the following command to start the web application:
