# DeepFake Detection

The DeepFake Detection project contains two main folders </br>

1.AI - This folder contains AI Jupyter notebook files used to develop the proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for forgery detection and classification. The notebook files illustrate the process of training and testing the model using the CASIA dataset.

2.WebApp - This folder contains the web application that is built on the Django framework and provides a user-friendly interface for detecting forged images.
